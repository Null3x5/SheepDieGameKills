Create a branch in your name and commit there, I'll merge branches later.
it works better that way, since you can update your code and commit without any issues

<h3>Updates:</h3>

Alright guys first merge is done! Ignacio's wolves are now integrated into the master game.

Andrew, I'm missing the minimap class from you so I can't merge you in just yet.

I'm still working on figuring out how to get input for sheep and wolf locations 

-Erick

hey if you merge something to master will that make everything from the last one erase?
just wondering

We should try to have all these branches merge as one by tomorrow just to make sure everything 
is running good. last thing we need is having great program and when we merge it all crashes. - Ignacio
                
                
                
<h3> STUPID COMMENTS </h3>

 Hey can we change the "HUNT" button to "RELEASE THE HOUNDS" or "I LET THE DOGS OUT" just to have a laugh lol. made it so that the wolfs still move at the end the game is not over when sheep die. wolfs just move around playing tag with each other. the pink one is it if you cant tell............ also if you hit the HUNT button one of the Sheep running in the background gets revived. - Ignacio
